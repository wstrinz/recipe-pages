    <p>7 Tbs. olive oil</p>
    <p>1 lb. white button mushrooms, quartered</p>
    <p>2 cups frozen pearl onions, thawed, or 2 regular onions, chopped</p>
    <p>Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste</p>
    <p>3 1/2 lb. beef chuck roast, cut into 1-inch cubes</p>
    <p>1 cup all-purpose flour</p>
    <p>3 garlic cloves, minced</p>
    <p>2 Tbs. tomato paste</p>
    <p>2 1/2 cups Irish stout, or something similar</p>
    <p>1 cup beef broth</p>
    <p>1 lb. carrots, cut into chunks</p>
    <p>1 lb. red potatoes, cut into chunks</p>
    <p>1 Tbs. finely chopped fresh thyme</p>
    <p> 1 egg, beaten with 1 tsp. water</p>
    <p>Stilton Pastry</p>
    <p>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
    <p>2 tsp. salt</p>
    <p>1 Tbs. sugar</p>
    <p>
      16 Tbs. (2 sticks/250g) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
    </p>
    <p>1/3 to 1/2 cup ice water</p>
    <p>4 oz. Stilton cheese (or other blue cheese), crumbled <br /></p>
    <p>
      In a food processor, combine the flour, salt and sugar and pulse until
      blended, about 5 pulses. Add the butter and process until the mixture
      resembles coarse meal, about 10 pulses. Add 1/3 cup of the ice water and
      pulse 2 or 3 times. The dough should hold together when squeezed with your
      fingers but should not be sticky. If it is crumbly, add more water 1 Tbs.
      at a time, pulsing twice after each addition. Turn the dough out onto a
      lightly floured work surface and shape into a disk. Wrap with plastic wrap
      and refrigerate for 1 hour.<br />Remove the dough from the refrigerator
      and let stand for 5 minutes. Sprinkle the top of the dough lightly with
      flour, place on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper and roll out
      into a 12-by-16-inch rectangle. Sprinkle the cheese over half of the
      dough, then fold the other half over the cheese. Roll out the dough into a
      16 1/2-inch square. Using a paring knife, trim the dough into a 16-inch
      round. Refrigerate the dough until firm, about 10 minutes, then lay the
      dough on top of the beef and stout pie and bake as directed in that
      recipe. Makes enough dough for a 16-inch round.<br />In a 5 1/2-quart
      Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm 1 Tbs. of the olive oil. Add the
      mushrooms, onions, salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, about
      12 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Or use any other casserole dish, fitting
      the shape of the pastry to it.<br />Season the beef with salt and pepper.
      Dredge the beef in the flour, shaking off the excess. In the Dutch oven
      over medium-high heat, warm 2 Tbs. of the olive oil. Add one-third of the
      beef and brown on all sides, about 7 minutes total. Transfer to a separate
      bowl. (cont)

      Add 1/2 cup water to the pot, stirring to scrape up the browned bits. Pour
      the liquid into a separate bowl. Repeat the process 2 more times, using 2
      Tbs. oil to brown each batch of beef and deglazing the pot with 1/2 cup
      water after each batch. (You can skip the first 2 deglazes, and just
      deglaze when done with browning all the beef). Return the pot to
      medium-high heat. Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook, stirring
      constantly, for 30 seconds. Add the beef, stout, broth and reserved
      liquid, stirring to scrape up the browned bits. Add the mushrooms, onions,
      carrots, potatoes and thyme and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to
      medium-low, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the beef and
      vegetables are tender, about 3 hours. Option, you can braise this in the
      oven at 350 degrees, covered, a few hours until beef is tender, or use a
      crockpot. Preheat an oven to 400°F.  Brush the rim of the pot with water.
      Lay the pastry round on top, allowing it to droop onto the filling. Trim
      the dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang, and crimp to seal. Brush the pastry
      with the egg mixture, then cut 4 slits in the top of the dough. Bake for
      30 minutes. Let the potpie rest for 15 minutes before serving. Serves 8 to
      10.
