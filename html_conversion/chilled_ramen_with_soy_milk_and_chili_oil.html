    </p>
    <p>Sichuan Chili Paste</p>
    <p>
      Bring ginger, sesame oil, vegetable oil, red pepper flakes, and paprika to
      a gentle simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Let bubble gently 30
      seconds, then remove from heat. Add sesame seeds, mirin, raw sugar, miso,
      sake, and Sichuan peppercorns and whisk until sugar is dissolved. Return
      paste to a gentle simmer, then let cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do Ahead: Sichuan chili paste can be made 1 month ahead. Cover and chill.
    </p>
    <p>Miso Tare</p>
    <p>
      Cook scallions, ginger, apple, garlic, miso, mirin, sake, toban djan, and
      red pepper flakes in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring, just
      until warm (do not let it simmer) and garlic no longer tastes raw, about 5
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do Ahead: Miso tare can be made 1 month ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.
    </p>
    <p>Chili Oil</p>
    <p>
      Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium-high until very hot but not quite
      smoking. Add scallions and paprika; season with salt. Cook, swirling pan
      often, until scallions are browned and oil is deep red, about 2 minutes.
      Let cool.
    </p>
    <p>Do Ahead: Chili oil can be made 1 month ahead. Cover and chill.</p>
    <p>Noodles and Assembly</p>
    <p>
      Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water according to package
      instructions until al dente. Drain, then immediately chill in a bowl of
      ice water. Drain again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toss cucumbers, bell pepper, and radishes with 3 Tbsp. Sichuan chili paste
      in a small bowl until well coated. Season to taste with salt. Toss in
      basil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whisk miso tare into milk in a medium bowl, then whisk in grapefruit zest
      and soy sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Divide noodles, then milk mixture and vegetables, among bowls. Toss
      granola or other crunchy toppings of choice in a little chili oil in a
      small bowl and scatter over noodles; drizzle with more chili oil.
