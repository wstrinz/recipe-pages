</h1>
<p>Professor Pedro's Puissant Potion</p>
<p>2015 Tweety Award Winner to Kellie and Will!</p>
<p>3 C strawberries, washed and roughly chopped</p>
<p>2 1/2 C sugar</p>
<p>3 C apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>2T whole peppercorns</p>
<p>
  Mash the strawberries and sugar in a bowl. Let sit for 1-2 hours in the
  fridge. Then add apple cider vinegar and peppercorns. Let sit in a covered
  container for several days (Keep tasting it to check fermentation/taste). We
  kept our mix in the fridge but for faster fermentation you could keep it on
  the counter according to the internet! Stir or shake gently everyday. At the
  end of the fermentation period strain out the strawberries and peppercorns.
  Save the shurb in a glass container in the fridge (lasts for a few months).
</p>
<p>
  Mix tequila, Strawberry Peppercorn Shrub, a squeeze of lime and a few basil
  leaves. (1 to 1 tequila to shrub) Mix and leave in the fridge for a few hours
  or overnight. Serve over ice with fizzy water (we used lemon flavored fizzy
  water). Recipe can be adapted for any juicy fruit, especially berries and
  stone fruits (even frozen), rhubarb + strawberries.

  water, and more as needed<br />2 tablespoons red wine vinegar

<p>
  Get out a large, heavy-bottomed soup pot and warm up the oil over medium heat.
  Add shallots, thyme, bay leaf, and red pepper flakes. Sauté, stirring
  occasionally, until everything is tender (about 5 minutes). Add carrots,
  beets, coriander, salt, pepper, and water, and bring everything to a boil.
  Cover the pot, turn the heat down, and let the soup simmer for about 20
  minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.   * Pick out the bay leaf and any
  tough thyme stems, and get out your blender. Puree the soup until it is smooth
  (carrot and beet soups are never as velvety as those made with squash, but get
  it as fine as you can) and pour it back into the pot. Add the vinegar, season
  with more salt and pepper to taste, and thin with a little more water if
  desired. Simmer for 5 minutes longer and serve hot.

  In a small bowl, whisk together oil, tamari, honey and 1 teaspoon vinegar.
  Toss half the mixture with the tofu, then toss in cornstarch. Arrange in a
  single layer on a rimmed sheet pan.
</p>
<p>
  (On a separate rimmed sheet pan, toss together potato wedges, 1/2 teaspoon
  salt and pepper. Arrange in a single layer; do not crowd the pan. If they
  don’t all fit, arrange extra wedges on the pan with the tofu.)
</p>
<p>
  Bake tofu and potatoes until browned, 35 to 40 minutes, flipping them halfway
  through. If the tofu sticks (and this is likely), use a thin metal spatula to
  carefully loosen each one before flipping. A small offset spatula is perfect
  here.
</p>
<p>
  (Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine scallions, 1 tablespoon vinegar and a
  large pinch each sugar and salt. Let sit while tofu and potatoes roast.)
</p>
<p>
  To serve, toss tofu with some of the reserved tamari sauce, to taste. Serve
  with potato wedges, topped with scallions, cilantro and a drizzle of hot
  sesame chile oil or sprinkling of red-pepper flakes, and more tamari sauce.
  Sprinkle with peanuts if desired.<br />(continued)

</p>
<p>3 tablespoons finely chopped garlic</p>
<p>2 tablespoons finely chopped peeled fresh ginger</p>
<p>1 1/4 teaspoons salt</p>
<p>
  1 small green fresh Thai or serrano chile, coarsely chopped, including seeds
</p>
<p>1 teaspoon white distilled vinegar</p>
<p>
  1/3 cup thick plain yogurt, such as Greek yogurt or lebneh, or drained regular
  yogurt
</p>
<p>1 1/2 tablespoons ground coriander</p>
<p>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</p>
<p>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon cayenne</p>
<p>
  1 (3- to 3 1/2-lb) chicken, quartered, then backbone and as much skin as
  possible discarded
</p>
<p>1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter</p>
<p>
  Marinate chicken: Purée onion, garlic, ginger, salt, chile, and vinegar to a
  smooth paste in a food processor. Transfer to a large wide bowl and whisk in
  yogurt, coriander, oil, turmeric, and cayenne. Add chicken pieces and turn to
  coat thickly. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate, chilled, at least 16
  hours. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before grilling.<br />Make
  ghee: Bring butter to a boil in a 1-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat.
  When foam completely covers butter, reduce heat to very low. Cook butter until
  a very thin crust begins to form on surface and milky white solids fall to
  bottom of pan, about 8 minutes. Continue to cook butter, watching constantly,
  until solids at bottom of pan turn light brown and butter has a nutty
  fragrance, 8 to 16 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let butter stand 1
  minute. Pour through a sieve lined with a dampened heavy-duty paper towel or a
  triple layer of cheesecloth into a bowl, discarding solids. Drizzle chicken
  with ghee and grill over indirect heat, serve with remaining ghee.

  side of grill; for a gas grill, leave 1 burner turned off). Brush grill rack
  with oil. Season chicken with salt and pepper and place, skin side down, on
  grill. Grill chicken, turning occasionally, until skin is crisp and browned
  and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh
  registers 165°, 10-15 minutes per side (move chicken to cooler part of grill
  if it's cooking too quickly). About 5 minutes before chicken is done, baste
  with some of dressing.

<p>½ teaspoon grated lemon zest</p>
<p>
  1/3 cup plain yogurt, preferably whole-milk (if using Greek, thin it down with

  Combine the chicken and potatoes in a large bowl. Season them with 2½
  teaspoons of the salt and ½ teaspoon of the pepper. In a small bowl, whisk
  together the harissa, cumin, and 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Pour this
  mixture over the chicken and potatoes, and toss to combine. Let it stand at
  room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the
  leeks, lemon zest, ¼ teaspoon of the salt, and the remaining 1½ tablespoons
  olive oil. Heat the oven to 425°F. Arrange the chicken and potatoes in a
  single layer on a large rimmed baking sheet, and roast for 20 minutes. Then

  crisped, 20 to 25 minutes longer. While the chicken cooks, place the yogurt in
  a small bowl. Grate the garlic clove over the yogurt, and season with the
  remaining ¼ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Spoon the yogurt over the
  chicken and vegetables in the baking sheet (or you can transfer everything to
  a platter if you want to be fancy about it). Scatter the herbs over the

<p>2 tablespoons tomato paste</p>
<p>1 cup red wine</p>
<p>1 (28-ounce can) plum tomatoes, pureed until smooth with their juices</p>
<p>1/4 cup chopped fresh flat leaf parsley, plus more for garnish</p>
<p>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</p>
<p>……(continued)</p>
<p>1 1/2 pounds eggplant, cut crosswise into 14-thick slices</p>
<p>Bechamel Sauce</p>
<p>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
<p>1/2 cup flour</p>
<p>2 1/2 cups milk</p>
<p>1 bay leaf</p>
<p>1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</p>
<p>2 eggs yolks</p>
<p>1 cup grated Romano</p>
<p>
  For the lamb: Soak the currants in warm water for 30 minutes. Drain. Heat 1
  tablespoon of the olive oil in a 6-quart saucepan over high heat. Add the
  lamb, cinnamon, cayenne, and salt and pepper and cook, stirring to break up
  the meat, until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer the lamb to a large
  strainer set over a bowl and drain; discard any liquid left in the pan. Return
  the pan to the heat and add the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil and heat
  until it begins to shimmer. Add the onions and bell pepper and cook until
  soft, about 5 minutes. Add the serrano and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add
  the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute. Return the lamb to the pan, add the
  wine, and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost completely evaporated,
  about 5 minutes. Add the tomato puree and currants and bring to a boil. Reduce
  the heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 30 minutes. Stir in
  the parsley and oregano and season with salt and pepper and honey, if needed.
  Remove from the heat. Broil eggplant.
</p>
<p>
  For the bechamel: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add
  the flour and cook, whisking constantly, until pale and smooth, 2 minutes.
  Still whisking constantly, add the milk and bay leaf and cook until thickened.
  Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg and discard the bay leaf. Let the sauce
  cool for 5 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, goat
  cheese, and lemon zest and whisk into the bechamel sauce until smooth. Preheat
  the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter a 3-quart baking dish or casserole dish.
</p>
<p>
  To assemble: Put half the eggplant slices in the dish and cover with half the
  meat sauce. Top the sauce with the remaining eggplant slices, and then the
  remaining meat sauce. Pour the bechamel over the top of the meat sauce and
  spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Sprinkle Romano evenly over the top,
  place the dish on a baking sheet, and bake until browned and bubbly, 45 to 50

<h1><a id="_Toc532643749"></a>Chinese BBQ Pork (Char Siu)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Marinade</p>
<p>3/4 tbsp sugar , brown or white (Note 1)</p>
<p>1 1/2 tbsp honey</p>
<p>1 1/2 tbsp hoisin sauce</p>
<p>1 tsp oyster sauce (not critical)</p>
<p>1 tbsp light soy sauce (Note 1)</p>
<p>1/2 tbs soy sauce (normal all purpose soy sauce) (Note 1)</p>
<p>1/2 tsp five spice powder (Note 2)</p>
<p>1/2 tsp sesame oil (not critical)</p>
<p>Few drops red food colouring </p>
<p>Pork</p>
<p>1 lb/ 500g pork shoulder</p>
<p>1 tbsp honey</p>
<p>
  Place the Marinade ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to simmer for
  just 30 seconds, then set aside to cool.
</p>
<p>
  Place the pork and Marinade in a ziplock bag. Remove as much air as possible,
  then massage it so the marinade is all over the Pork. Place in the fridge and
  marinate for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight (up to 24 hours).
</p>
<p>To Roast</p>
<p>Take the pork out of the fridge and bring it to room temperature.</p>
<p>
  Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Line a baking tray with foil or baking/parchment
  paper and place a rack on top (rack is recommended but not critical).
</p>
<p>Remove pork from the marinade, save Marinade.</p>
<p>Mix 1 tbsp honey into Marinade.</p>
<p>
  Place the pork on the rack and tuck the thin end of the tenderloin underneath
  so the whole piece is roughly the same thickness.
</p>
<p>
  Roast for 25 minutes or until the internal temperature is 145 - 160F/ 65 -
  70C. Around halfway through roasting, baste generously with the reserved
  Marinade. Sort of dab it on so you get as much Marinade on the pork as
  possible - this is key for getting the thick, glossy glaze.
</p>
<p>Allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.</p>
<p>
  Serve with rice and steamed Chinese greens. It is also great to serve on
  noodle soups, or chopped up inside Chinese pancakes or steamed buns.

  salt<br />3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided<br />1 large shallot, finely
  chopped<br />¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons cognac<br />1 cup heavy cream<br />2
  teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper<br />1 tablespoon green peppercorns in
  brine<br />4 garlic cloves, crushed<br />4 small sprigs rosemary; plus more
  for serving (optional)
</p>
<p>
  Rub steaks all over with 1 Tbsp. oil and season generously with salt. Heat 2
  Tbsp. oil and 1 Tbsp. butter in a saucepan over medium-low. Cook shallot until
  golden brown, 10–15 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully add ¼ cup cognac.
  Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook until cognac is
  reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Stir in cream and black pepper and simmer.
  Cook until cream is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes; cool slightly.
  Transfer mixture to a blender and blend until smooth (or use an immersion
  blender directly in the pot). Add green peppercorns, pulse just to break up
  (do not blend completely). Return sauce to saucepan; add salt. Cover. Heat
  remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high. Add steaks and
  cook, occasionally lifting steaks to allow oil to flow underneath, until a
  brown crust forms underneath, about 4 minutes. Turn steaks and cook until
  crust forms on the other side and an instant-read thermometer inserted into
  the thickest part registers 125° about 4 minutes. Transfer steaks to a cutting
  board and let rest 10 minutes. Pour off all but 2 Tbsp. fat from skillet and
  return to medium-high heat. Place steaks, garlic, rosemary, and remaining 2
  Tbsp. butter in skillet and cook, basting and turning halfway through, until
  butter is fragrant and golden brown, about 1 minute. Increase heat to high.
  Lean safely away from pan, add remaining 2 Tbsp. cognac, and immediately tilt
  skillet toward flame to ignite cognac (if cognac doesn’t ignite, it’s okay).
  Cook, carefully shaking skillet flames), until flames die out, about 30
  seconds. Transfer steaks back to cutting board let rest 10 minutes, slice.

<p>1/3 to 1/2 cup ice water</p>
<p>4 oz. Stilton cheese (or other blue cheese), crumbled <br /></p>
<p>
  In a food processor, combine the flour, salt and sugar and pulse until
  blended, about 5 pulses. Add the butter and process until the mixture
  resembles coarse meal, about 10 pulses. Add 1/3 cup of the ice water and pulse
  2 or 3 times. The dough should hold together when squeezed with your fingers
  but should not be sticky. If it is crumbly, add more water 1 Tbs. at a time,
  pulsing twice after each addition. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
  work surface and shape into a disk. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate for
  1 hour.<br />Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let stand for 5
  minutes. Sprinkle the top of the dough lightly with flour, place on a lightly
  floured sheet of parchment paper and roll out into a 12-by-16-inch rectangle.
  Sprinkle the cheese over half of the dough, then fold the other half over the
  cheese. Roll out the dough into a 16 1/2-inch square. Using a paring knife,
  trim the dough into a 16-inch round. Refrigerate the dough until firm, about
  10 minutes, then lay the dough on top of the beef and stout pie and bake as
  directed in that recipe. Makes enough dough for a 16-inch round.<br />In a 5
  1/2-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm 1 Tbs. of the olive oil. Add
  the mushrooms, onions, salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, about
  12 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Or use any other casserole dish, fitting the
  shape of the pastry to it.<br />Season the beef with salt and pepper. Dredge
  the beef in the flour, shaking off the excess. In the Dutch oven over
  medium-high heat, warm 2 Tbs. of the olive oil. Add one-third of the beef and
  brown on all sides, about 7 minutes total. Transfer to a separate bowl. (cont)
</p>
<p>
  Add 1/2 cup water to the pot, stirring to scrape up the browned bits. Pour the
  liquid into a separate bowl. Repeat the process 2 more times, using 2 Tbs. oil
  to brown each batch of beef and deglazing the pot with 1/2 cup water after
  each batch. (You can skip the first 2 deglazes, and just deglaze when done
  with browning all the beef). Return the pot to medium-high heat. Add the
  garlic and tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds. Add the
  beef, stout, broth and reserved liquid, stirring to scrape up the browned
  bits. Add the mushrooms, onions, carrots, potatoes and thyme and bring to a
  boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally,
  until the beef and vegetables are tender, about 3 hours. Option, you can
  braise this in the oven at 350 degrees, covered, a few hours until beef is
  tender, or use a crockpot. Preheat an oven to 400°F.  Brush the rim of the pot
  with water. Lay the pastry round on top, allowing it to droop onto the
  filling. Trim the dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang, and crimp to seal. Brush
  the pastry with the egg mixture, then cut 4 slits in the top of the dough.
  Bake for 30 minutes. Let the potpie rest for 15 minutes before serving. Serves

  occasionally with tongs, until wilted and bright green, 2 to 3 minutes per
  batch. Transfer as cooked to a colander, then rinse under cold water until
  cool and drain well. Squeeze small handfuls of spinach to remove as much
  moisture as possible, then in 3 batches wrap spinach in several layers of
  paper towels and squeeze to remove even more moisture. Coarsely chop spinach.
  On a 16-inch sheet of plastic wrap, form half of spinach into a 13 1/2- by 1
  1/2-inch log. Repeat with remaining spinach on another sheet of plastic wrap.
  Use plastic wrap and your hands to roll, compact, and smooth sides of logs.
  Remove and discard plastic wrap. With a sharp knife, cut each spinach log
  crosswise into 9 (1 1/2-inch) pieces (18 total), then arrange, cut sides up,
  on a platter, reshaping and smoothing mounds with your fingers. Finely grind 2
  teaspoons sesame seeds in a blender, then add peanut oil, vinegar, mirin,
  shoyu, sesame oil, and salt and blend until combined well. Spoon 1 teaspoon
  dressing over each spinach mound, stirring dressing occasionally (it will
  separate as it stands), and sprinkle mounds with remaining 4 teaspoons sesame
  seeds.

<h1>
  <a id="_Toc532643771"></a><img src="52.jpeg" />Buttery Pull-Apart Milk Rolls
</h1>
<p>
  10 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces, divided<br />¾ cup whole
  milk, divided<br />3 tablespoons plus 2¼ cups bread flour<br />1 ¼-ounce
  envelope active dry yeast (about 2¼ teaspoons)<br />2 tablespoons sugar<br />2
  large eggs<br />2 teaspoons kosher salt<br />Flaky sea salt
</p>
<p>
  Place 5 Tbsp. butter in a medium bowl. Cook remaining 5 Tbsp. butter in a
  small saucepan over medium heat, until butter foams and turns golden brown.
  Remove from heat; scraper all into bowl with butter pieces. Reserve saucepan.
  Stir until all butter is melted. Let sit, stirring occasionally, until butter
  is room temperature and solidified, 15–20 minutes.<br />Whisk ¼ cup milk, 3
  Tbsp. flour, and ¼ cup water in reserved saucepan until smooth, then set over
  medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until it becomes a very stiff paste
  resembling mashed potatoes, about 2 minutes. Scrape into the bowl of a stand
  mixer; reserve saucepan.<br /><em>Gently</em> heat remaining ½ cup milk in
  reserved saucepan over low (warm to the touch but not steaming hot). Remove
  from heat and let sit 1 minute. Add yeast and whisk until dissolved. Let
  mixture sit until foamy (it may not foam – just use fresh yeast), about 5
  minutes.<br />Brush bottom and sides of a 13x9" baking dish with 2 Tbsp
  butter. Set aside another 2 Tbsp. butter in a small bowl for brushing over
  baked rolls.<br />Add yeast mixture, sugar, 1 egg, and remaining 2¼ cups flour
  to paste in mixer bowl. Using the dough hook, mix on low speed until a shaggy
  dough forms. Add kosher salt, increase speed to medium, and continue mixing
  until dough forms a smooth single mass, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low
  again and add remaining butter a tablespoonful at a time, waiting until
  incorporated before adding more. Once all of the butter has been added,
  increase mixer speed back to medium and mix dough until very soft, smooth, and
  supple, another 8–10 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl; form dough into a ball
  and place in bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm draft-free
  spot until doubled in size, 45–60 minutes.<br />Punch down dough and knead
  several times to deflate, then turn out onto a clean work surface. To form the
  rolls, divide dough into 15 equal pieces (about 1½ oz. each). Working one at a
  time and keeping other pieces covered in plastic, fold edges of dough
  underneath, pinching bottom to seal. Turn 90° and fold and pinch again. Repeat
  process until you have created a smooth sphere with no seams except at the
  bottom.<br />(cont.)
</p>
<p>
  <br />Place ball on work surface and rest the side of your hand next to it so
  your palm and fingers are cupped around it. Drag the ball toward you, using
  friction against the work surface to create tension and stretch the surface of
  the dough into a smooth, taut dome. This shaping method tightens the gluten
  over the surface so the rolls rise evenly upward and outward instead of
  slumping into amorphous blobs. Repeat with remaining balls of dough and place
  in prepared pan in a 5x3 grid, spacing evenly apart.<br />Loosely cover pan
  with plastic wrap and let rolls rise in a warm draft-free spot until doubled
  in size and touching, 35–45 minutes (to test, poke one with an oiled finger;
  dough should spring back but leave a slight indentation).<br />Place a rack in
  middle of oven; preheat to 375°. Beat remaining egg in another small bowl
  until yolks and whites are incorporated and no streaks remain. Gently brush
  tops of rolls with egg, then sprinkle with sea salt.
</p>
<p>
  Bake rolls until they are deep golden brown, 20–25 minutes. Transfer pan to a
  wire rack and brush warm rolls with reserved 2 Tbsp. garlic butter; let cool
  in pan 10 minutes.
</p>
<p>
  Slide an offset spatula around sides and underneath rolls to loosen, then
  invert onto rack and turn right side up. Let cool at least another 15 minutes
  before serving.
</p>
<p>
  Do Ahead: Dough can be formed into rolls (do not let rise) 1 day ahead; cover
  and chill. Let rise before baking; this may take around 3 hours.

<h1><a id="_Toc532643772"></a><img src="53.jpeg" />Irish Soda Bread</h1>
<p>
  4 cups flour<br />2 Tbsp sugar<br />½ teaspoon salt<br />3 teaspoon baking
  powder<br />¼ teaspoon baking soda<br />8 Tbsp butter<br />1 cup currants
  <br />2 eggs, lightly beaten<br />1 cup buttermilk (cont.)
</p>
<p>
  325◦ oven, greased baking sheet. Whisk together flour, sugar, salt, baking
  soda, and baking powder. Work the butter into the flour with a pastry cutter
  or your fingers until it resembles coarse meal, then add in the currants or
  raisins. Make a well, add buttermilk, egg, and vanilla mix in with a fork.
  Dust hands with a little flour, then gently knead dough in the bowl just long
  enough to form a rough ball. If the dough is too sticky to work with, add in a
  little more flour. Do not over-knead! Transfer dough to a lightly floured
  surface and shape into a round loaf. Transfer dough to a large, lightly
  greased cast-iron skillet or a baking sheet (it will flatten out a bit in the
  pan or on the baking sheet). Using a serrated knife, score top of dough about
  an inch and a half deep in an "X" shape. Bake about 40-50 minutes (check
  sooner) until bread is golden and bottom sounds hollow when tapped. Check for
  doneness also by inserting a long, thin skewer into the center. If it comes
  out clean, it's done. Let cool a few minutes: Remove pan or sheet from oven,
  let bread sit in the pan or on the sheet for 5-10 minutes, then remove to a
  rack to cool briefly. Serve bread warm, at room temperature, or sliced and
  toasted. Best when eaten warm and just baked.

<h1><a id="_Toc532643776"></a>Morning Buns</h1>
<p>Special equipment: 2 giant muffin tins</p>
<p>
  <strong><img src="57.jpeg" /></strong>For the Dough:
</p>
<p>
  3 cups (361 grams) all-purpose flour<br />1 tablespoons granulated sugar<br />2¼
  teaspoons instant (rapid-rise) yeast<br />¾ teaspoon salt<br />1½ cups (340
  grams) unsalted butter, cut into ¼-inch-thick slices and chilled (maybe
  less)<br />1 cup (227 grams) sour cream, chilled<br />¼ cup (57 grams) orange
  juice, chilled<br />3 tablespoons ice water<br />1 egg yolk
</p>
<p>
  For the Filling:<br />½ cup (99 grams) granulated sugar<br />½ cup (106 grams)
  light brown sugar<br />1 tablespoon grated orange zest<br />2 teaspoons ground
  cinnamon<br />1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</p>
<p>
  Prepare the Dough: Combine flour, sugar, yeast and salt in a large zipper-lock
  bag. Add butter, seal and shake to evenly coat butter. Press the air out of
  the bag and reseal. Roll over the bag several times with a rolling pin,
  shaking bag after each roll, until butter is pressed into large flakes.
  Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in sour cream, orange juice, water
  and egg yolk until combined. Turn dough onto a floured surface and knead
  briefly to form a smooth, cohesive ball. Roll dough into a 20x12-inch
  rectangle. Starting at the short end, roll dough into a tight cylinder. Pat
  cylinder flat into a 12x4-inch rectangle and transfer to a parchment
  paper-lined rimmed baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for 15
  minutes.<br />Prepare the Filling: grease giant muffin tins (2) with crisco.
  In a medium bowl, stir together the sugars, orange zest, cinnamon and vanilla.
  Remove the dough from the freezer and place on a lightly floured surface. Roll
  the dough into a 20x12-inch rectangle and sprinkle evenly with the filling,
  leaving ½-inch border around the edges. Lightly press the filling into the
  dough. Starting at the long end, roll the dough into a tight cylinder and
  pinch lightly to seal the seam. Trim ½-inch of dough from each end and
  discard. Cut the cylinder into 12 equal pieces and transfer cut-side-up to the
  prepared muffin tin. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at
  least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
  Preheat oven to 200 degrees F. When oven reaches temperature, turn it off.
  Remove muffin tin from refrigerator and discard plastic wrap. Place buns in
  the turned-off oven until puffed and doubled in size, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove
  buns from oven and heat oven to 425 degrees F. Bake for 5 min, then reduce
  oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Bake until buns are golden brown, about 20
  additional min. Allow buns to cool in the muffin tin for 5 min, then remove
  and transfer to a wire rack, cool upside down. The buns are best served fresh
  and warm, but can be frozen (microwave thawed frozen buns for 30 sec x 2 to
  warm – perfect at Bearskin Lodge).

<h1><a id="_Toc532643777"></a>No Knead Pizza Dough</h1>
<p>
  7 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (1000 grams) plus more for shaping dough<br />4
  teaspoons fine sea salt<br />1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast
</p>
<p>
  Whisk flour, salt, and yeast in a medium bowl. While stirring with a wooden
  spoon, gradually add 3 cups water; stir until well incorporated. Mix dough
  gently with your hands to bring it together and form into a rough ball.
  Transfer to a large clean bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let dough rise at
  room temperature (about 72°) in a draft-free area until surface is covered
  with tiny bubbles and dough has more than doubled in size, about 18 hours
  (time will vary depending on the temperature in the room). Transfer dough to a
  floured work surface. Gently shape into a rough rectangle. Divide into 6 equal
  portions. Working with 1 portion at a time, gather 4 corners to center to
  create 4 folds. Turn seam side down and mold gently into a ball. Dust dough
  with flour; set aside on work surface or a floured baking sheet. Repeat with
  remaining portions. Let dough rest, covered with plastic wrap or a damp
  kitchen towel, until soft and pliable, about 1 hour.<br />DO AHEAD: Can be
  made 3 days ahead. Wrap each dough ball separately in plastic wrap and chill.
  Unwrap and let rest at room temperature on a lightly floured work surface,
  covered with plastic wrap, for 2–3 hours before shaping.<br />To Make the
  Pizzas During the last hour of dough's resting, prepare oven: If using a pizza
  stone, arrange a rack in upper third of oven and place stone on rack; preheat
  oven to its hottest setting, 500°–550°, for 1 hour. If using a baking sheet,
  arrange a rack in middle of oven and preheat to its hottest setting,
  500°–550°. (You do not need to preheat the baking sheet.) Working with 1 dough
  ball at a time, dust dough generously with flour and place on a floured work
  surface. Gently shape dough into a 10"–12" disk. If Using Pizza Stone When
  ready to bake, increase oven heat to broil. Sprinkle a pizza peel or rimless
  (or inverted rimmed) baking sheet lightly with flour. Place dough disk on
  prepared peel and top with desired toppings.<br />Using small, quick
  back-and-forth movements, slide pizza from peel onto hot pizza stone. Broil
  pizza, rotating halfway, until bottom of crust is crisp and top is blistered,
  5–7 minutes.<br />Using peel, transfer to a work surface to slice. Repeat,
  allowing pizza stone to reheat under broiler for 5 minutes between pizzas. If
  using a Baking Sheet Arrange dough disk on baking sheet; top with desired
  toppings. Bake pizza until bottom of crust is crisp and top is blistered,
  about 10 minutes. Transfer to a work surface to slice. Repeat with remaining
  pizzas.

<p><em>Quick Method Danish Pastry:</em></p>
<p>3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p>1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) chilled unsalted butter</p>
<p>2 packages active dry yeast</p>
<p>1/2 cup warm water</p>

<p>(cont.)</p>
<p>
  <em>Butter Cream Filling:</em> (could increase filling amount by 50% - happy
  accident N Shore 2017)
</p>
<p>1/4 cup (1/2 stick) soft butter</p>
<p>1 cup powdered sugar</p>
<p>1/4 teaspoon almond extract</p>
<p>1 cup finely pulverized almonds or almond flour</p>
<p>1 (3-ounce) package almond paste</p>
<p>1 egg white</p>
<p>Glaze:</p>
<p>1 slightly beaten egg</p>
<p>2 tablespoons milk or water</p>
<p>Pearl sugar or crushed sugar cubes, for topping</p>
<p>Chopped or sliced almonds for topping</p>
<p>Quick Method Danish Pastry:</p>
<p>
  Measure 3 1/2 cups flour into a bowl or work bowl of food processor with steel
  blade in place. Cut the butter into 1/4-inch slices and add to the flour.
  Process or cut the butter into the flour until the butter is about the size of
  kidney beans. In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Let stand
  5 minutes. Stir in the cream or milk, cardamom, salt, eggs, and sugar.
</p>
<p>
  Turn the flour-butter mixture into the liquid ingredients, and with a rubber
  spatula mix carefully just until the dry ingredients are moistened. Cover and
  refrigerate 4 hours, overnight, or up to 4 days. Turn the dough out onto a
  lightly floured board; dust with flour. Pound and flatten to make a 16- to
  20-inch rectangle. Fold into thirds, making 3 layers. Turn dough around and
  roll out again. Fold from the short sides into thirds. This should result in a
  perfect square. <br />Repeat folding and rolling again if you wish. Wrap and
  chill the dough 30 minutes or as long <br />as overnight.
</p>
<p>To make the Danish Pastry Braid:</p>
<p>
  Cover two baking sheets with parchment paper or lightly grease and flour them.
</p>
<p>
  Divide the chilled dough into 2 parts. Roll each part out to make a rectangle
  12 by 6 inches. Place these strips on the prepared baking sheets. To make the
  filling, cream the butter and sugar until light. Blend in the almond extract,
  almonds, almond paste, and egg white. Spread filling down the length of the
  center of the strips. Cut slanting strips at 3/4-inch intervals <br />along
  both sides up toward the center using a pastry wheel. Fold strips over the
  filling in a crisscross manner
</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 400ºF.</p>
<p>
  Let strips rise for 15 to 30 minutes, just until the pastry strips look puffy;
  they will not double.
</p>
<p>
  To make a glaze, beat the egg with the milk or water. Brush the pastry lightly
  with it. Sprinkle the sugar and/or sliced almonds over the top.
</p>
<p>Bake about 15 minutes or until golden.</p>

  <a id="_Toc532643782"></a>Almond Apricot Pound Cake with Amaretto<strong>
    (from the book “Eat Cake”)</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  1 1/2 cups blanched almonds, lightly toasted/ or 1 cup of almond flour
  (better)
</p>
<p>3 cups plus 3 tablespoons granulated sugar</p>
<p>1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</p>
<p>4 oz. almond paste</p>
<p>6 large eggs, at room temperature</p>
<p>2 teaspoons pure almond extract</p>
<p>1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</p>
<p>1/4 cup Amaretto or other almond liqueur</p>
<p>
  1/4 cup apricot or orange brandy or orange bitters + orange liqueur/ triple
  sec+ vodka
</p>
<p>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p>1/2 cup cake flour, sifted</p>
<p>3/4 tsp salt</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p>1 cup full-fat sour cream</p>
<p>
  2/3 cup chopped dried apricots, preferably unsulphured – California preferred
</p>
<p>
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan and tap out
  excess flour, holding center tube if it is a removable bottomed pan. Process
  almonds and 3 tablespoons of sugar in a food processor until finely ground,
  then set aside. In a large bowl, or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the
  paddle attachment, cream butter and remaining 3 cups of sugar together for 3
  to 4 minutes, or until mixture is very fluffy and pale. Add almond paste and
  cream until well blended. There may be a few little pieces of almond
  paste that don't break up in the batter -- this will add a little texture and
  pockets of flavor to the finished cake. (If the paste is not soft enough to
  cream, grind it in a food processor with the almonds and add it to the batter
  when the nuts are added.) Scrape down the sides of the bowl and do so
  frequently from now on. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well between each
  addition. Beat in the almond and vanilla extracts, Amaretto, and apricot
  brandy. Sift together the flours, salt, and baking soda. Add the flour mixture
  to the creamed batter in three additions, alternately with the sour cream in
  two additions, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients so the batter
  never gets too dry, causing the flour to become overworked. Fold in the
  chopped apricots and ground nuts and scrape the butter into the prepared pan,
  smoothing the surface with a rubber spatula. Bake the cake in the center of
  the oven for 1 1/2 hours to 1 3/4 hours, or until a wooden skewer inserted
  into the center of the cake comes out clean and the cake is beginning to pull
  away from the sides of the pan. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack for 15
  minutes. Run a thin-bladed knife around the outside of the cake and the center
  tube. If the pan has a removable bottom, lift the tube out, freeing the cake.
  Invert the cake onto a wire rack and pull out the tube and bottom. If the pan
  does not have a removable bottom, invert the cake onto the rack.

<p>
  <strong><img src="70.jpeg" /></strong>For ganache filling and frosting
</p>
<p>2 cups heavy cream</p>
<p>1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter</p>
<p>
  16 oz fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), finely chopped
</p>
<p>6 marrons glacés (candied chestnuts), finely chopped (optional)</p>
<p>For cake layers</p>
<p>
  9 oz bottled whole shelled roasted chestnuts (1 1/2 cups) or chestnut puree
</p>
<p>2 cups cake flour (not self-rising)</p>
<p>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
<p>2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, softened</p>
<p>1 1/2 cups packed light brown sugar</p>
<p>4 large eggs</p>
<p>1 teaspoon vanilla</p>
<p>3/4 cup sour cream</p>
<p>For chocolate Cognac mousse</p>
<p>3/4 stick (6 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into pieces</p>
<p>8 oz fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), finely chopped</p>
<p>5 tablespoons Cognac</p>
<p>3/4 cup chilled heavy cream</p>
<p>2 large egg whites (<em>pasteurized</em>)</p>
<p>1/4 cup granulated sugar</p>
<p>Garnish: caramelized chestnuts</p>
<p>
  Special equipment: 3 (8-inch) round cake pans; an 8-inch round of cardboard,
  covered with foil if not wax-coated
</p>
<p>Make ganache:</p>
<p>
  Bring cream and butter to a simmer in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan, then
  reduce heat to low. Whisk in chocolate until smooth and remove from heat.
  Transfer ganache to a bowl and chill, covered, stirring every 30 minutes,
  until thickened but spreadable, about 2 hours. (If ganache becomes too stiff,
  let stand at room temperature until slightly softened.)
</p>
<p>Make cake layers while ganache chills:</p>
<p>
  Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter cake pans and line bottom of each with a round
  of parchment or wax paper. Butter paper and dust pans with flour, knocking out
  excess flour.
</p>
<p>
  Pulse chestnuts with flour, baking soda, and salt in a food processor until
  finely ground.
</p>
<p>
  Beat butter and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at
  medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes in a standing mixer
  or about 6 minutes with a handheld.
</p>
<p>
  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, then beat in vanilla
  (mixture will look a little separated). Reduce speed to low and add flour
  mixture and sour cream alternately in 3 batches, beginning and ending with
  flour and mixing until just combined.
</p>
<p>
  Divide batter evenly among pans and bake in middle of oven until pale golden
  and springy to the touch, about 30 minutes. Cool cakes in pans on racks, then
  invert onto racks and remove parchment.
</p>
<p>Make mousse and assemble torte:</p>
<p>
  Melt butter and chocolate in a double boiler or a metal bowl set over a
  saucepan of barely simmering water, stirring until smooth, and stir in Cognac.
  Transfer to a bowl and chill, covered, stirring occasionally, until thickened
  to the consistency of softened butter, about 1 hour. (If mixture becomes too
  stiff, let stand at room temperature until softened.)
</p>
<p>
  Beat cream in a bowl with cleaned beaters until it just holds soft peaks, then
  chill, covered, while beginning to assemble torte.
</p>
<p>
  Put 1 cake layer on cardboard round on a rack set in a shallow baking pan (1
  inch deep). Spread 1/2 cup ganache evenly over top of layer and sprinkle with
  all of chopped marrons glacés. Top marrons glacés with another 1/4 cup ganache
  and cover with another cake layer.
</p>
<p>
  Beat egg whites with a pinch of salt using cleaned beaters at medium-high
  speed until they just hold soft peaks. Add sugar and beat at high speed until
  whites just hold stiff peaks. Stir whipped cream into chocolate Cognac
  mixture, then stir in one third of whites to lighten. Fold in remaining whites
  gently but thoroughly. Spoon mousse immediately onto cake layer (it sets
  quickly), spreading evenly, then top with third cake layer. Chill torte,
  covered, until mousse layer is firm, about 1 hour. Keep remaining ganache at a
  spreadable consistency at room temperature, chilling, covered, if it becomes
  too soft.
</p>
<p>Glaze cake:</p>
<p>
  Reserve 1 1/4 cups ganache in a metal bowl, then spread remainder over top and
  side of torte to seal in crumbs. Chill until firm, about 1 hour.
</p>
<p>
  Set bowl of reserved ganache over a saucepan of barely simmering water,
  stirring until ganache reaches a pourable consistency. Remove bowl from heat
  and cool 5 minutes. Pour ganache evenly over top of torte, making sure it
  coats all of side. Shake rack gently to smooth glaze (let excess drip into
  baking pan). Transfer cake on cardboard to a cake stand or plate using 2 large
  heavy metal spatulas and chill until set. Garnish just before serving.
</p>
<p>Cooks' notes:</p>
<p>
  • Cake layers can be made 3 days ahead, cooled completely, then chilled,
  individually wrapped well in plastic wrap. • Ganache can be made 3 days ahead
  and chilled, covered. Let stand at room temperature 2 to 3 hours to soften to
  a spreadable consistency. • Torte can be assembled 2 days ahead and chilled,
  covered with a cake dome.

  peaks form when the beaters are lifted. Whisk half the flour mixture into the
  yolks (it will seem like paste). Whisk a quarter of the egg whites into the
  yolk mixture to lighten it. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in another
  quarter of the whites. Sift half of the remaining flour mixture over the
  batter and fold in. Fold in another quarter of the egg whites followed by the
  rest of the sifted flour and finally the rest of the whites. Scrape batter
  into the pan and smooth the top with the spatula. Bake until the cake is
  golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25
  minutes. Let cool. Meanwhile in a blender or food processor, purée the mango
  with 2 to 3 tablespoons sugar. When the cake is cool, use a fork to poke holes
  all over the top, then cut the cake into 18 pieces, but don’t take the pieces
  out of the pan. In a small saucepan over medium heat stir together the coconut
  milk, condensed milk, remaining 1/3 cup milk, brandy and a pinch of salt. Heat
  <br />until steaming, then pour it evenly over the cake. Cover and chill the
  cake for at least 1 hour <br />or overnight.
</p>
<p>
  Just before serving, whip the cream with the cinnamon and half of the puréed
  mango until thick and mousse-like. Taste and add more sugar if it tastes flat.
  Spread the mango cream on the cake, then dollop on the remaining mango purée.
  Use a spatula to swirl the mango purée into a marble-like pattern. Or use the
  purée as a sauce when you serve the cake.

  lightly packed premium unsweetened cocoa, preferably Dutch-processed<br />1/4
  cup whole milk<br />2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br />1 cup toasted
  chopped nuts (such as walnuts, pecans, or hazelnuts)
</p>
<p>Center an oven rack and preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
<p>
  To make the cake, melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk
  in the cocoa. Add the oil and water and bring to a rolling boil for 30
  seconds. Remove the pan from the heat and set it aside to cool slightly.
  Meanwhile, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt in a large
  bowl, then whisk the ingredients by hand to ensure they are well mixed. Pour
  the warm cocoa mixture into the sifted ingredients and whisk until just
  combined. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla.
  With a rubber spatula, stir the buttermilk mixture into the batter. Pour the
  batter into the greased pan and place in the center of the oven. Bake until
  the top is firm and a wooden skewer inserted in the middle of the cake comes
  out with moist crumbs, 32 to 35 minutes.
</p>
<p>
  While the cake is in the oven, make the frosting: melt the butter in a
  saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the cocoa and bring the mixture to a
  rolling boil; boil for 30 seconds. Remove from heat and whisk in the milk and
  vanilla. Add the confectioners' sugar 1 cup at a time while whisking
  continuously. Immediately after the cake comes out of the oven, pour the
  frosting over the hot cake and sprinkle with the nuts. Try not to jiggle the

<p>
  1 cup (2 sticks) plus 2 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces

</p>
<p>
  Working quickly and aggressively, use your fingers to rub butter into flour to
  create large, shaggy pieces of dough (the idea is to smash the butter into the
  flour, creating some pieces that are flat and thin and some that are large and
  chunky).
</p>
<p>
  Combine vinegar and 3 Tbsp. ice water in a small bowl and drizzle over flour
  mixture, running your fingers through the flour as you drizzle to evenly
  distribute (think of running your fingers through your hair). Knead dough in
  the bowl until it starts to come together (it will still look a little dry).
</p>
<p>
  Turn dough out onto a work surface and knead 1 or 2 more times, pressing to
  incorporate shaggy edges. Divide dough into 2 pieces and press into about
  1"-thick disks. Wrap with plastic and chill at least 1 hour.
</p>
<p>
  Do Ahead: Dough can be made 5 days ahead; keep chilled, or freeze up to 1

<p>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces</p>
<p>5 teaspoons cornstarch</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
<p>5 teaspoons all-purpose flour plus more for dusting</p>
<p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
<p>
  3 pounds firm but ripe pears (such as Comice, Anjou, or Bartlett), peeled,
  cored, thinly sliced
</p>
<p>1 large egg, beaten to blend</p>
<p>3 tablespoons granulated sugar or raw sugar</p>
<p>
  <br />Bring granulated sugar, rosemary, and 1 1/2 cups wine to a boil; cook,
  stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 2/3 cup, 5–8 minutes. Strain
  through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. Whisking constantly, gradually
  add butter and whisk until syrup is smooth.
</p>
<p>
  Whisk cornstarch, cinnamon, 5 teaspoons flour, and remaining 1/4 cup wine in a
  small saucepan set over medium heat; cook, whisking constantly, until
  thickened, about 1 minute. Slowly add syrup, whisking until smooth, then stir
  in vanilla and salt. Chill until cool, about 30 minutes. Place a rack in lower
  third of oven and preheat to 375°F. Toss pears and red wine syrup in a large
  bowl. Roll out 1 disk of dough on a lightly floured surface into a 14" round.
  Transfer to a 9" pie dish. Lift up edges and allow dough to slump down into
  dish. Trim, leaving about 1" overhang. Pour filling into crust and chill.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, roll out remaining disk of dough into a 14" round. Using a pizza
  cutter or a sharp knife, cut into twelve 1"-wide strips. Arrange 6 strips
  crosswise across top of pie, spacing about 1" apart. Arrange remaining 6
  strips lengthwise across top of pie, lifting crosswise strips and weaving
  lengthwise strips over and under to form a lattice. Brush edge of dough with
  beaten egg and press ends of strips and bottom crust together to seal. Trim
  strips to same length as bottom crust, then fold bottom crust over lattice
  strips; crimp edge. Brush crust with beaten egg and sprinkle with granulated
  sugar. Chill in freezer 15 minutes.

<p>
  Place pie dish on a rimmed baking sheet and bake 30 minutes. Reduce oven
  temperature to 350°F, rotate pie, and continue baking, tenting with foil if
  crust is browning too quickly, until juices are bubbling and crust is golden
  brown, 60–75 minutes longer. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool at least 4
  hours before slicing.

<h1><a id="_Toc532643854"></a><img src="107.x-emf" />Karovas</h1>
<p>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p>1/2 cup Dutch process cocoa (or regular)</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt or 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p>11 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature</p>
<p>2/3 cup packed light brown sugar</p>
<p>1/4 cup sugar</p>
<p>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</p>
<p>
  ¾ cup chocolate chips or 5 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped into
  chip-size bits
</p>
<p>
  Sift the flour, cocoa, salt and baking soda together. In a large bowl, beat
  butter until oft and creamy. Add the brown and granulated sugars, the salt and
  the vanilla extract and beat for another minute or two. Reduce the mixer speed
  to low and add the sifted dry ingredients. Mix only until the dry ingredients
  are incorporated - the dough will look crumbly and that's just right. For the
  best texture, you want to work the dough as little as possible once the flour
  is added. Toss in the chocolate pieces and mix only to incorporate.<br />Turn
  the dough out onto a smooth work surface, divide it in half and, working with
  one half at a time, shape the dough into a log that is 1 1/2 inches in
  diameter. (Cookie-dough logs have a way of ending up with hollow centers, so
  as you're shaping a log, flatten it once or twice and roll it up from one long
  side to the other, just to make certain you haven't got an air channel.) Wrap
  the logs in plastic wrap and chill them for at least 1 hour. <br />Preheat the
  oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, or use
  silpats. Working with a sharp thin-bladed knife, slice rounds that are 1/2 -
  inch thick. (Don't be upset when the cookies break, just squeeze the
  broken-off bit back onto the cookie.) Place the cookies on the parchment-lined
  sheets leaving about 1 inch of spread space between each cookie. Bake only one
  sheet of cookies at a time and bake each sheet for 12 minutes. <br />The
  cookies will not look done, nor will they be firm, but that's just the way
  they should be. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and let the
  cookies rest, on the baking sheet, until only just warm or until they reach
  room temperature—it's your call. Repeat with the second sheet of cookies.

<p>6 large eggs</p>
<p>Pinch of kosher salt</p>
<p>1 cup (2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces</p>
<p>2 cups mixed berries</p>
<p>
  Bring lemon zest, lemon juice, and ¼ cup sugar to a bare simmer in a large
  heavy saucepan over medium heat, whisking to dissolve sugar, then remove from
  heat.<br />Whisk eggs, salt, and ½ cup sugar in a large bowl until light and
  thick, about 1 minute. Whisking constantly, gradually pour about one-quarter
  of hot lemon mixture into egg mixture, then, whisking constantly, incorporate
  egg mixture into remaining lemon mixture in saucepan. Cook over medium heat,
  whisking constantly, until lemon curd is opaque and thick enough to hold the
  marks of the whisk, about 2 minutes.<br />Scrape lemon curd into a blender.
  With motor on medium speed, add butter a piece at a time, waiting until each
  piece is fully incorporated before adding the next, until the butter is
  emulsified and curd is light and thick.<br />Transfer lemon curd to a large
